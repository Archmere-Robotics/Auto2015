Autonomous program for 2014-2015 season

-Some nitpicky rules:

PLEASE document your functions like you would for a javadoc:
        /**
         * Here is the description
         * @param param1 the first parameter
         * @param param2 the seccond parameter
         * @return what ever the function returns
         */
         int doSomething(int param1, int param2);
You don't have to have a @return tag if it returns void, but please document the stuff. The description should be in the header file.

Also: please make sure that the code compiles before pushing it to the repo; if you find a bug you can't fix, you can compile it, but also log an issue.
